/** @brief The class ContactForceModelBuilderFactory.

	Creates the contact force model for each pair of materials. 
	This class manages the mapping of material types from strings, as specified 
	in the XML input file, to integer IDs, which are then used within the 
	`RigidBody` class.

	1. Material Mapping:
		- Materials are represented as strings in the XML input file, but in the
		 `RigidBody` class, materials are stored as integer IDs.
		- To facilitate this, we maintain a map that associates material strings
		  with integer material IDs.
		- When constructing a new `RigidBody`, we use this map to ensure that 
		  each material string is associated with a unique integer ID. 
		- If a material string is encountered for the first time, it is added to
		  the map with a new ID.
		- The map is stored on the CPU, which works for both CPU and GPU 
		  implementations. When `RigidBodies` are copied from host to device, 
		  the material ID is passed along as a parameter.

	2. Handling `contactForceParameters`:
		- The `contactForceParameters` are specified in the XML file using pairs
		  of material strings.
		- We store these parameters as a 1D array, where each pair of materials 
		  corresponds to an index in the array.
		- To access the appropriate `contactForceParameters` for a pair of 
		  materials, we use a hash function that converts two material IDs into 
		  a unique index in the array.
		- For the hash, material IDs for particles and obstacles are considered.
		  We exclude contact between two obstacles, but particle-particle and 
		  particle-obstacle interactions are supported.

	3. Hashing Strategy:
		- We use a triangular indexing approach hash = l * ( l + 1 ) / 2 + s,
		  where l is the larger index and s is the smaller one. Visualization:
		  		p0(0)  p1(1)  p2(2)  o0(3)  o1(4)
			p0    0      1      3      6     10
			p1    -      2      4      7     11
			p2    -      -      5      8     12
			o0    -      -      -      9     13
			o1    -      -      -      -     14
		  Apparently, indices 9, 13, and 14 will never be accessed, but is fine
		  for now. The better way to exclude obst-obst pairs is shown below.
		- Material IDs are assigned such that particle IDs are listed before 
		  obstacle IDs. This ensures that obstacle-obstacle interactions are not
		  considered in the hash, as they are not relevant.
		- The hash is computed by summing the IDs of two materials, with the 
		  following table serving as an example:
				p0(0)  p1(1)  p2(2)  o0(3)  o1(4)
			p0    0      1      3      6      9
			p1    -      2      4      7     10
			p2    -      -      5      8     11
			o0    -      -      -      -      -
			o1    -      -      -      -      -
		  Here, `pX` represents particles, and `oX` represents obstacles. 
		  Particle-particle and particle-obstacle interactions are supported, 
		  while obstacle-obstacle interactions are ignored by the hash function.
		  We use a triangular hashing strategy here, and an OFFSET to take care
		  of obstacles.

	4. Constraints:
		- **Obstacles Must Be Numbered Last:** 
		  This is important because we do not consider contact forces between 
		  two obstacles. By reading particles first and obstacles later, the 
		  hash naturally excludes obstacle-obstacle interactions.

	5. Error Handling:
		- It is possible for the user to omit certain material pairs from the 
		  XML input.
		- We do not validate this during input parsing. If an undefined contact 
		  pair is accessed during the simulation, it could result in a `NULL` 
		  pointer dereference, causing the simulation to crash.
		- It is left to the user to ensure that all necessary material pairs are
		  properly defined.
