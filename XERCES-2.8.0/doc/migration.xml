    <s2 title="Migrating from &XercesCName; 2.7.0 to &XercesCName; &XercesCVersion;">
      <p>The following section is a discussion of the technical differences between
      &XercesCName; 2.7.0 code base and the &XercesCName; &XercesCVersion;.</p>

      <p>Topics discussed are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><link anchor="NewFeatures280">New features in &XercesCName; &XercesCVersion;</link></li>
        <li><link anchor="API280">Public API Changes</link></li>

    <s3 title="New features in &XercesCName; &XercesCVersion;">
      <ul>
        <li>Exponential growth of memory block (from 16KB to 128KB) that are allocated by the DOM heap.</li>
        <li>The NODE_CLONED notification is now sent to each node's user data handler when cloning the entire DOMDocument.</li>
        <li>On Windows extract the registry code page from MIME\Database\Charset\&lt;encoding>\@InternetEncoding instead of MIME\Database\Charset\&lt;encoding>\@Codepage.</li>
        <li>Allow whitespace-only nodes to be added as children of a DOMDocument.</li>
        <li>When a node is cloned or imported the type information (PSVI) is also copied.</li>
        <li>When using SAX2, including XMLReaderFactory to use createXMLReader doesn't include xercesc/parsers/SAX2XMLReaderImpl.hpp anymore. If you need to cast the SAX2XMLReader to SAX2XMLReaderImpl,
            you need to include this header yourself.</li>
