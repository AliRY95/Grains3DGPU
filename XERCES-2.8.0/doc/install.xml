      <s3 title="Source distribution">
        <p>The &XercesCName; source is available in the source distribution:
           &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.zip.</p>

        <p>Install the &XercesCName; source distribution by using <code>unzip</code>
		on the &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.zip archive in the Windows environment. You can
		use WinZip, or any other UnZip utility:</p>
<source>
unzip &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.zip
</source>
        <p>This creates the &apos;&XercesCSrcInstallDir;&apos; sub-directory
		containing the &XercesCName; source distribution. </p>

        <p>If you need to build the &XercesCName; source after installation,
        please follow the <jump href="build.html">Build Instructions</jump>.</p>

      </s3>
      <s3 title="Binary distribution">
        <p>Install the &XercesCName; binary distribution by using <code>unzip</code>
	   on the &XercesCInstallDir;-{arch}-windows-{compiler}.zip archive in
           the Windows environment. Here {arch} denotes the CPU architecture
           and {compiler} denotes the C++ compiler of your choice. You can use
           WinZip, or any other UnZip utility. For example:</p>

<source>
unzip &XercesCInstallDir;-x86-windows-vc_8_0.zip
</source>

        <p>This creates a &apos;&XercesCInstallDir;-x86-windows-vc_8_0&apos;
           sub-directory containing the &XercesCName; binary distribution.</p>

        <p>You need to add the &apos;&XercesCInstallDir;-{arch}-windows-{compiler}\bin&apos;
	   directory to your path.
           To do this go to the start menu, click the settings menu and
           select control panel. When the control panel opens, double
           click on System and select the &apos;Environment&apos; tab.
	   Locate the PATH variable under system variables and add
           &lt;full-path-to-&XercesCInstallDir;-{arch}-windows-{compiler}>\bin
           to the PATH variable.</p>

        <p>The binary distribution contains the pre-built parser libraries
           and sample executables. Please refer to the
           <jump href="samples.html">Samples</jump> for how to run the
           samples.</p>

        <p>The &XercesCName; source is available in the source distribution:
           &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar.gz.</p>

        <p>Install the &XercesCName; source distribution
           &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar.gz by extracting the files
           from the compressed archive:</p>
<source>
gzip -d &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar.gz
tar -xf &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar
</source>
        <p>This creates the &apos;&XercesCSrcInstallDir;&apos; sub-directory
	   containing the &XercesCName; source distribution. </p>

        <p>If you need to build the &XercesCName; source after installation,

      <s3 title="Binary distribution">
        <p>Install the binary distribution &XercesCInstallDir;-{arch}-{os}-{compiler}.tar.gz
           by extracting the files from the compressed archive. Here {arch}
           denotes the CPU architecture, {os} denotes the operating system,
           and {compiler} denotes the C++ compiler of your choice.
           For example:</p>
<source>
gzip -d &XercesCInstallDir;-x86-linux-gcc_3_4.tar.gz
tar -xf &XercesCInstallDir;-x86-linux-gcc_3_4.tar
</source>
        <p>This will create an '&XercesCInstallDir;-x86-linux-gcc_3_4'
           sub-directory containing the &XercesCName; binary distribution.</p>

        <p>You will need to add the
           &XercesCInstallDir;-{arch}-{os}-{compiler}/bin directory to your
           PATH environment variable:</p>

        <p>For Bourne Shell, K Shell or Bash, type: </p>
<source>
export PATH="$PATH:&lt;full-path-to-&XercesCInstallDir;-{arch}-{os}-{compiler}>/bin"
</source>
		<p>For C Shell, type:</p>
<source>
setenv PATH "$PATH:&lt;full-path-to-&XercesCInstallDir;-{arch}-{os}-{compiler}>/bin"
</source>

        <p>If you wish to make this setting permanent, you need to change
	   your profile by changing your setup files which can be either
           .profile or .kshrc.</p>

        <p>In addition, you will also need to set the library search path.
           (LIBPATH on AIX, LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Solaris and Linux,
            SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX, and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X).</p>

        <p>In the following shell commands, the &lt;xerces-path>
           denotes the full path to the
           &XercesCInstallDir;-{arch}-{os}-{compiler} directory. For
           Bourne Shell, K Shell or Bash, type:</p>
<source>
export LIBPATH=&lt;xerces-path>/lib:$LIBPATH (AIX)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;xerces-path>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Solaris, Linux)
export SHLIB_PATH=&lt;xerces-path>/lib:$SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX)
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;xerces-path>/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (Mac OS X)
</source>

    	<p>For C Shell, type:</p>
<source>
setenv LIBPATH "&lt;xerces-path>/lib:$LIBPATH" (AIX)
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "&lt;xerces-path>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" (Solaris, Linux)
setenv SHLIB_PATH "&lt;xerces-path>/lib:$SHLIB_PATH" (HP-UX)
setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH "&lt;xerces-path>/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" (Mac OS X)

        <p>Install the &XercesCName; source distribution

           from the compressed archive:</p>
<source>
tar -xfz &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar.gz
</source>
        <p>This creates the &apos;&XercesCSrcInstallDir;&apos; sub-directory

        </p>

      </s3>

      <s3 title="Binary distribution">
        <p>Install the binary distribution by running
           <jump href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</jump> setup.exe.
           When you reach the "Packages" step of the Cygwin Setup wizard,
           expand the "Devel" category, then click in the "New" column next
           to "xerces-c-devel" until it reads "&XercesCVersion;-X".</p>

        <p>This will install the necessary libraries and include files
           for the &XercesCName; binary distribution.</p>

        <p>If you wish to run programs linked to &XercesCName; that were
           built in the Cygwin environment, you need to add your Cygwin
           "bin" directory to your Windows PATH environment variable.
           In typical Cygwin installations, the bin directory is in the
           Cygwin directory on the drive that windows is installed on.
           For instance, if windows is installed to "C:\Windows\System32",
           Your Cygwin bin directory may be "C:\cygwin\bin".</p>

        <p>The binary distribution contains the pre-built parser libraries.
           Sample executables may be available in a future release on the
           Cygwin platform.  In the meantime, they may be built from the
           source distribution by following the
           <jump href="build.html">Build Instructions</jump> for
          "Building samples".</p>
